The Gulp Tasks folder is where your individual Tasks should be stored. In here, I have a Styles.JS file that defines variables to certain PostCSS packages, then uses the PostCSS packages to perform a TASK.

Styles.JS will use AutoPrefixer, PostCSS, Mixins ect. to help you organize CSS.

Watch.JS will use BrowserSync to automatically refresh my browser when changes to any files listed are made. It will also use CSSInject.
